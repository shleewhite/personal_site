          We look at how this new technology currently affects accessibility. It
          is important to note that these considerations are for web components
          and extend to Lightning Web Components as well.

        <p slot="desc">
          Web components are a new set of APIs built on web standards that are
          widely adopted by browsers. They allow developers to make flexible
          custom componentsâ€“but with that flexibility comes responsibility.

          One of the most common requests is how to optimize apps for blind or
          low-vision users. While this may be a small percentage of your user
          base, as an #AwesomeAdmin the positive outcomes of optimizing for
          these users is indeed very large.

        <p slot="desc">
          Building an app that is accessible and inclusive isn't just a legal
          requirement, it makes good business sense. We'll focus on common
          interaction patterns and best practices using Lightning Web Components
          with accessibility baked-in.
